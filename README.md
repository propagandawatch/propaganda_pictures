# Propaganda In A New Era

> Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past. - George Orwell

This is a crowdsourced archive of posters, online advertisements, and other ephemera in modern China. The goal is to track and collect political messaging across the country -- which is why we need you! If you have **firsthand** photos, feel free to share them to propagandawatch@protonmail.com. 

We are trying to make this archive filter-able by location, time -- and hoepfully in the future -- slogans and tags! So be sure to send that info over too :)
