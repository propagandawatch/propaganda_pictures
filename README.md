# Propaganda In A New Era

This is a crowdsourced archive of posters, online advertisements, and other ephemera in modern China. The goal is to track and collect political messaging across the country -- which is why we need you! 

If you have **firsthand** photos, feel free to share them to propagandawatch@protonmail.com. Be sure to send the location (city, province) and date that it was taken too :)

We are working on making this archive easier to browse and explore. Some filters we're considering are: location, date, slogans, and tags (ex: Xi Jinping, crime, military). If you have any thoughts or suggestions, feel free to email us!
